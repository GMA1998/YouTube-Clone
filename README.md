# YouTube-Clone
This is a front-end web project that aims to clone the popular video-sharing platform YouTube. It is a single-page application (SPA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project includes several features that make it similar to the real YouTube website, such as a video player, a search bar, and a list of recommended videos.
