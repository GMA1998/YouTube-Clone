# YouTube-Clone
This is a front-end web project that aims to clone the popular video-sharing platform YouTube. It is a single-page application (SPA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project includes several features that make it similar to the real YouTube website, such as a video player, a search bar, and a list of recommended videos.

Features:

1.Home page: The home page displays a list of recommended videos and allows users to search for videos using the search bar.
2.Video player: The video player allows users to play videos on the site. It includes controls for playing, pausing, and skipping ahead or back in the video.
3.Recommended videos: The recommended videos section displays a list of videos that are similar to the one the user is currently watching. These videos are generated based on the user's viewing history and preferences.
4.Channel page: Each channel has its own page that displays the channel's videos and information about the channel.
5.Subscriptions: Users can subscribe to channels and receive notifications when new videos are uploaded.
6.User profile: Users can create a profile that displays their uploaded videos, playlists, and subscriptions.
